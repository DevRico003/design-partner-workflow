## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decision
[Key architectural choices and rationale]

### Components Affected
- [ ] **Frontend**: [specific components - e.g., src/components/booking/BookingForm.tsx]
- [ ] **Backend**: [API endpoints - e.g., /api/bookings/recurring]
- [ ] **Database**: [schema changes - e.g., add recurring_bookings table]
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: [deployment/config - e.g., environment variables]

### Dependencies
- **Required packages**: []
- **External services**: []
- **Related features**: []
- **Breaking changes**: []

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation [~Xh]
- [ ] Create/update database schema and migrations
- [ ] Set up base types and interfaces in TypeScript
- [ ] Create initial API structure and routing
- [ ] Add necessary environment variables

### Phase 2: Core Logic [~Xh]
- [ ] Implement business logic and validation rules
- [ ] Create service layer functions
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement data access layer

### Phase 3: UI Implementation [~Xh]
- [ ] Build/update React components using shadcn/ui
- [ ] Connect components to API endpoints
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement responsive design

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish [~Xh]
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Manual testing of user flows
- [ ] Performance optimization and cleanup
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Could block development)
- [List critical issues that could prevent completion]

### Medium Risk (Needs monitoring)
- [List issues that could cause delays or require changes]

### Low Risk (Minor concerns)
- [List minor issues that are manageable]

### Mitigation Strategies
- [How to address each high/medium risk]

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- **Unit tests**: [What will be unit tested]
- **Integration tests**: [API endpoints and workflows to test]
- **E2E tests**: [Critical user flows to test]

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Happy path**: Normal user flow works correctly
- [ ] **Error scenarios**: Proper error handling and messages
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- [ ] **Performance**: Acceptable response times
- [ ] **Mobile**: Responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility requirements met
- [ ] **Browser compatibility**: Works in target browsers

## Rollback Plan
[How to safely revert if issues arise in production]
- Database rollback procedure: [steps]
- Feature flag disable: [if applicable]
- Code rollback: [git strategy]
- Communication plan: [who to notify]

## Definition of Done
