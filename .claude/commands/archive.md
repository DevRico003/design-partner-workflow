Archive completed or abandoned development plans to keep the workspace clean.

When the user says "/archive $ARGUMENTS", you should:

1. **Identify the plan**: Find the plan file matching $ARGUMENTS
2. **Validate status**: Ensure plan is ready for archiving (completed, abandoned, or old draft)
3. **Create archive structure**: Set up appropriate directory in `/plans/archive/`
4. **Move and update**: Transfer plan and update its status to "archived"
5. **Update index**: Refresh `/plans/INDEX.md` to reflect changes
6. **Confirm action**: Show what was archived and where

## Archive Structure
```
/plans/archive/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ q4/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ completed/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature-name.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ abandoned/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ old-draft.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ q3/
â””â”€â”€ 2025/
    â””â”€â”€ q1/
```

## Archival Rules
- **Completed plans**: Move to `archive/YYYY/qN/completed/`
- **Abandoned plans**: Move to `archive/YYYY/qN/abandoned/`
- **Old drafts**: Plans with "Status: draft" older than 30 days
- **Preserve history**: Keep original creation date and metadata

## Status Updates
When archiving, update the plan file:
```markdown
- **Status**: archived
- **Archived**: 2024-12-23
- **Archived By**: [User/System]
- **Archive Reason**: completed | abandoned | stale_draft
```
